    <p>
      LXCOMM itself is licensed under the MIT or Apache-2.0 at a given contributor's choice.
      However, it makes use of the SteamCMD binary/shell script for interacting with and downloading from the Steam Workshop.
      For ease of use, this flatpak comes with SteamCMD bundled. By installing this flatpak,
      you agree to Valve's usage terms as laid out by their Steam Subscriber Agreement as well as
      SteamCMD's own license agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of either of these licenses,
      you should not install the LXCOMM flatpak.
